# python-challenge

A project for reading and analyizing csv files done for Georgia Tech's Data Analysis Bootcamp.

Notes:

- PyBank was written to explicitly work on one read through. Due to the small csv size, more concise code could be written but this was written so the file could grow arbitrarily large
- PyPoll was written with dicts to drastically decrease code size
